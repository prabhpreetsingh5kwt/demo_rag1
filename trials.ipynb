      "A Powertrain Plan is a type of vehicle service contract that specifically covers the major components of a vehicle's powertrain, including the engine, transmission, and drivetrain. This type of plan is designed to protect against unexpected and potentially expensive repairs to these crucial components. Powertrain plans are beneficial because they can help reduce out-of-pocket expenses for repairs that may not be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. Additionally, these plans can be customized to suit your driving habits and needs, providing peace of mind and financial protection in case of powertrain-related issues.\n"

Why take chances with your investment?\\n\\nIn the event that your vehicle is stolen, accidentally damaged beyond repair, or otherwise declared an insured total loss, your insurance company pays the actual cash value of the vehicle at the time of loss—not what the vehicle’s really worth to you! You remain liable for payment of the difference between your insurance company’s settlement and the balance of your loan/lease. This deficiency, added to the amount of your deductible, time lost from work, rental car costs, replacement vehicle, and other expenses, can easily be thousands of dollars. Money that comes out of your pocket!\\n\\n# Primary Insurance\\n\\n- Settlement: $25,000*\\n- Deficiency: $20,000\\n- Loan Balance: $15,000\\n- Deductible: $10,000\\n-\\n-\\n-\\n\\n*Vehicle actual cash value (less) consumer deductible.\\n\\nBenefits of the Advanced Protection Products International, Inc.

You remain liable for payment of the difference between your insurance company’s settlement and the balance of your loan/lease. This deficiency, added to the amount of your deductible, time lost from work, rental car costs, replacement vehicle, and other expenses, can easily be thousands of dollars.

But what if your loan or lease balance is higher than the market value of your vehicle?\\n\\nAnswer: You would be responsible for paying off the difference, including your deductible. This can be expensive.\\n\\nThe reason for the potential difference is that normally the loan/lease balance decreases at a predictable amount as monthly payments are made. However, the market value of your vehicle is influenced by several variable factors (e.g. supply, demand, mileage). This means that market value often may be lower than your outstanding balance - particularly early in your contract when you have the most to lose.\\n\\nTHE CHOICE IS YOURS...\\n\\nGAP is an optional form of protection available only at the time you sign your Retail Finance or Lease Contract with the dealership. If you would like to know more about GAP, ask to see the GAP addendum.\\n\\nGuaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) can help waive the difference from the current market value of your vehicle.\\n\\nImportant Note: Based on your insurance company paying NADA Retail Value for the vehicle at the time of loss. The amount waived will not include any amount financed in excess of 120% of the MSRP for new vehicles or 120% of the NADA average retail value for used vehicles on the date of contract.\\n\\nDisclaimer: Besides the limitations listed on the back panel, terms and conditions may vary by state.\\n\\nAdditional Information: The percentage may vary.

As a result, repair costs and labor rates have risen and will likely continue to do so. The cost of even one future repair may easily exceed the cost of purchasing a service contract.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s important to take care of your vehicle in accordance with the manufacturer guidelines, even with the best attention and care to your vehicle, mechanical breakdowns can occur unexpectedly and require costly repairs. The simple truth is that even the most reliable vehicles on the road are at risk for a breakdown, especially as your vehicle ages and accrues mileage. If you have a vehicle service contract, you can drive knowing that you have coverage that will be there even after your manufacturer’s basic warranty has expired, which is when you are likely to need it the most.\\n\\nWe offer four levels of coverage ranging from basic powertrain to exclusionary, which is our top-of-the-line contract that provides coverage for all the parts of your vehicle, unless they are specifically excluded in the contract.\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\nWide range of service contract options\\n\\nNo exclusions for normal wear and tear\\n\\nMultiple deductible options to choose from\\n\\nRepair facilities throughout the U.S. and Canada\\n\\nOption to extend coverage before contract term expires\\n\\nNo exclusions for covered pre-existing conditions\\n\\nCOVERAGE\\n\\nWith any of our service contracts, you have the confidence of knowing that your vehicle has coverage throughout the United States and Canada. You can even choose the length and type of coverage that best fits your driving habits and matches your specific needs. Hopefully you will never have a problem, but driving with a service contract will reassure you while on the road.\\n\\nIn addition to paying for covered repairs, CNA National service contracts include these benefits:\\n\\nTowing and emergency roadside assistance\\n\\nTravel and lodging reimbursement\\n\\nRental car reimbursement\\n\\nVehicle service contract diagram\\n\\nValuable Features of Your Coverage\\n\\nValuable Features of Your Coverage\\n\\nRoadside Assistance\\n\\nSimply call our toll-free number 24 hours a day, seven days a week for our sign-and-drive service or towing. Alternatively, you can call your own provider and we will reimburse you up to certain dollar limits.\\n\\nRental Car Reimbursement\\n\\nWe will pay for a rental vehicle when a covered breakdown occurs.\\n\\nTravel and Lodging Reimbursement\\n\\nWe will reimburse your meals and lodging up to a certain amount if you are stranded more than 100 miles from home due to a covered breakdown.\\n\\nWhat Does a Vehicle Service Contract Offer That a Factory Warranty Doesn’t?\\n\\nIn the event of a mechanical breakdown, a Vehicle Service Contract (VSC) can help reduce costs to repair or replace components not covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. The program also provides additional benefits such as towing, rental car, limp-along assistance, and emergency roadside assistance for covered breakdowns. The coverage continues until the expiration date of the contract or when the expiration odometer mileage is reached, whichever occurs first.\\n\\nCan a Vehicle Service Contract Save Me Money?\\n\\nYes. The new and advanced technology in today’s vehicles, combined with inflation, supply chain issues, and uncertainty about the future, have all increased the complexity of basic repairs. As a result, repair and labor costs are likely to continue increasing. The cost of just one significant repair could exceed the cost of purchasing a contract today.\\n\\nCan the Purchase Price Be Included in My Monthly Vehicle Payment?\\n\\nYes, the cost of coverage can be added to your monthly payment, but it can only be done when you purchase your vehicle. If you are financing your vehicle, ask your dealer how you can add the cost of this coverage to your finance contract.\\n\\nWhat Should I Do If My Vehicle Breaks Down?\\n\\n...\\n\\nEV Service Contract Policy Brochure\\n\\nEV Service Contract Policy Brochure\\n\\nWhere Can I Take My Vehicle for Repairs if I\\'m Far from Home?\\n\\nIf you\\'re unable to return to the dealership, your vehicle service contract will be accepted at thousands of licensed repair facilities throughout the U.S. and Canada. If you have a breakdown far from home, your towing benefit can help get you to a nearby repair facility.\\n\\nEV Service Contract\\n\\nWe assembled a team of experts who conducted detailed research across the industry and analyzed internal claims data to develop a service contract focused exclusively on battery-powered electric vehicles.\\n\\nElectric vehicles are distinctly different from gas-powered and hybrid vehicles. However, most other EV service contracts offer coverage for parts that are not even in the vehicle!\\n\\nExperienced\\n\\nWe\\'ve been covering electric vehicles with our Z2 service contract for more than five years. Based on the claims data we collected from those contracts combined with exhaustive research and intensive study of these automobiles, we\\'ve become the industry expert and built a service contract with the premier coverage that is synonymous with CNA National.\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nWe didn\\'t take the easy way by wedging a battery paragraph into our standard service contract. We built a one-of-a-kind service contract with four levels of coverage—from stated component to exclusionary with battery—designed to be attractive to consumers while also helping protect dealers\\' losses and reinsurance positions.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nWe took the initiative and time to learn about these unique vehicles to ensure we could not only offer a top-tier product, but also be able to effectively train and educate all of our clients on the marketing, sale, and administration of our EV service contract. As the industry expert, we are your resource.\\n\\nElectric Vehicle Service Contract\\n\\nLevels of Coverage\\n\\nStandard Protect\\n\\nStated-component coverage for crucial components with value in mind.\\n\\nPremier Protect\\n\\nThe most comprehensive stated-component coverage.\\n\\nElite Protect\\n\\nComprehensive exclusionary coverage.\\n\\nElite Protect with Battery\\n\\nElite protect coverage that includes the propulsion battery.\\n\\nWhy did CNAN create this product?\\n\\nWith the year-over-year increase in adoption rates and consumer interest for electric vehicles, our electric vehicle service contract offers a new service contract that is custom built to address EV-specific components. This product provides a service contract option unlike any other in the marketplace and will offer consumers peace of mind with their electric vehicle purchase.\\n\\nWhat is different about this new product?\\n\\nWe developed our electric vehicle service contract exclusively for battery-powered electric vehicles and created tiers of coverage specific to components found in these vehicles. We assembled a team of experts to conduct detailed research across the industry and analyzed internal claims data to better understand EV component failures, manufacturing procedures, and consumer concerns. Our expertise was then used to develop a service contract with protection specific to battery electric vehicles and their components.\\n\\nIs a new dealer agreement or sign-up needed?\\n\\nNo, a new dealer agreement or sign-up is not needed for this electric vehicle service contract.\\n\\nEV Service Contract Policy Brochure\\n\\nEV Service Contract Policy Brochure\\n\\nCoverage for Propulsion Battery\\n\\nThe Elite Protect with Battery tier offers the highest level of protection. The electric vehicle\\'s propulsion battery will be repaired or replaced when it retains less than the original equipment manufacturer\\'s capacity allowance.\\n\\nReinsurance Options\\n\\nThe EV service contract is eligible for all reinsurance options. Dealers signed up for Z2 reinsurance will automatically be signed up for reinsurance with the EV service contract.\\n\\nTermProtect Service Contract\\n\\nDrive with confidence on the road ahead. Our service contract provides peace of mind by covering your vehicle and offering different lengths and types of coverage to fit your driving habits and specific needs.\\n\\nBenefits of the Service Contract:\\n\\nStay up to date with the latest safety, convenience, fuel economy, and driver-assist technology.\\n\\nProtection from maintenance and mechanical breakdowns.\\n\\nCoverage for items not included in the manufacturer\\'s warranty.\\n\\nHelps limit future repair costs with advanced technology coverage.\\n\\nValuable Features:\\n\\nRoadside assistance.\\n\\nVehicle Service Contract Policy\\n\\nVehicle Service Contract Policy\\n\\n24/7 Sign-and-Drive Service\\n\\nSimply call our toll-free number 24 hours a day, seven days a week for our sign-and-drive service or towing. Alternatively, you can call your own provider and we will reimburse you up to a certain dollar limit.\\n\\nRental Car Reimbursement\\n\\nWe will pay for a rental vehicle when a covered breakdown occurs.\\n\\nLimp-Along Assistance\\n\\nWe will pay up to a certain amount to deliver a mobile charge for electric vehicles in the event the propulsion battery is depleted while on the road.\\n\\nTravel and Lodging Reimbursement\\n\\nWe will reimburse your meals and lodging up to a certain amount if you are stranded more than 100 miles away from home.\\n\\nBenefits of a Vehicle Service Contract\\n\\nIn the event of a mechanical breakdown, a Vehicle Service Contract (VSC) can help reduce costs to repair or replace components not covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. The program also provides additional benefits such as towing, rental car, limp-along assistance, and emergency roadside assistance for covered breakdowns. Coverage continues until the contract expiration date or when the expiration odometer mileage is reached, whichever occurs first.\\n\\nCan a Vehicle Service Contract Save You Money?\\n\\nYes. With the increasing complexity of vehicle repairs due to advanced technology, inflation, supply chain issues, and uncertainty about the future, repair and labor costs are likely to continue rising. The cost of a significant repair could exceed the price of purchasing a contract today.\\n\\nGuaranteed Asset Protection (GAP)\\n\\nWhen your vehicle is declared a total loss after an accident or theft, the actual cash value determined by your auto insurance company may be significantly less than the outstanding balance on your loan. Our GAP waiver programs can help cover the difference between the actual cash value of your vehicle and what you still owe.\\n\\nGAP Waiver Policy Brochure\\n\\nWhat is a GAP Waiver?\\n\\nA GAP waiver is designed to reduce or eliminate amounts remaining on your loan after your vehicle is stolen or declared a total loss.\\n\\nHow Does it Work?\\n\\nWhen your vehicle is declared a total loss due to theft or an accident, your primary automobile insurance will typically pay the actual cash value of the vehicle at the time of loss. This amount may be less than the outstanding balance on your loan, creating a \"gap.\" The GAP waiver helps by waiving some or all of what is owed, excluding certain items like past-due payments and late fees.\\n\\nCoverage Overview\\n\\nAvailable for new and used vehicles\\n\\nCan be financed on loans up to 84 months\\n\\nCan be financed on loans up to 150% of the MSRP (new vehicles) or NADA retail value (used vehicles)\\n\\nAvailable for vehicles with a retail sales value up to $100,000\\n\\nNote: Terms, conditions, limits of liability, exclusions, and state-specific provisions may vary. Please refer to the actual waiver for details.\\n\\nSubmitting a Claim\\n\\nIn order to submit a GAP waiver claim, your vehicle must first be declared a total loss by your insurance company. Contact your automobile insurance provider for more information.\\n\\nVisit the GAP Waiver Claim Documents page for a list of required documents to submit a claim.\\n\\nIllustrative Example for a $30,000 Loan\\n\\nIllustrative example content here...\\n\\nPolicy Brochure\\n\\nReduce or Eliminate Your Out-of-Pocket Expense with GAP\\n\\nYour out-of-pocket savings could be substantial:\\n\\nLoan balance: $30,000\\n\\nActual cash value of lost vehicle: -$22,000\\n\\nGap amount: $8,000\\n\\nPrimary insurance deductible: +$1,000\\n\\nTotal out-of-pocket expense: $9,000\\n\\nWith a GAP waiver, this amount can be reduced to as little as: $0\\n\\nFor illustrative purposes only. Your individual situation will vary depending on the details of your financing, vehicle specifics, and driving history. Some of your loan may remain even after the waiver is applied, due to missed payments, amounts previously due, late fees, and other adjustments, including any loan amount that exceeds 150% of the (“NADA”) Official Used Car Guide retail value of your vehicle.\\n\\nCertified Warranty\\n\\nCertified vehicles are increasingly important to today\\'s consumers. There is value in knowing a vehicle has been thoroughly inspected and vetted before resale, and CNA National works with select auto dealers to create dealer-certified warranty programs that offer a top level of coverage to help provide that reassurance.\\n\\nBenefits\\n\\nPurchasing a vehicle that comes with a limited warranty helps provide peace of mind against the unknowns that accompany buying a used car. CNA National works with select auto dealers to create certified warranty programs that can help eliminate some of these risks. Customers also have the opportunity to purchase a vehicle service contract that \"wraps\" around the coverage afforded in the limited warranty, adding additional years and often additional types of coverage that can help guard against unexpected repair costs.\\n\\nCoverage\\n\\nAsk your dealer what type and term of limited warranty they offer. And be sure to ask about CNA National service contracts to wrap the limited warranty!\\n\\nLimited Powertrain Warranties & Wraps\\n\\nCNA National Warranty and Service Contracts\\n\\nWarranty Options\\n\\nDealers can offer customers a choice of limited powertrain warranties at no additional cost, designed to cover repairs of powertrain components.\\n\\nYou can even add an optional \"wrap\" service contract to enhance the warranty with additional comprehensive coverage.\\n\\nLifetime Limited Warranty\\n\\nThe CNA National Lifetime Limited Powertrain Warranty and Lifetime Wrap program can provide consumers with mechanical breakdown coverage for as long as they own the vehicle.\\n\\nUnlimited Miles & Stated Time\\n\\nThe CNA National Unlimited Miles & Stated Time Powertrain Warranty and Wrap program can provide mechanical breakdown coverage for consumers who need higher mileage limits.\\n\\nUnlimited Time & Stated Miles\\n\\nThe CNA National Unlimited Time & Stated Miles Powertrain Warranty and Wrap program can provide consumers with mechanical breakdown coverage for the long term owner.\\n\\nAncillary Suite of Products\\n\\nWe can help keep your vehicle looking good, too! Our ancillary product mix is diverse and provides products to protect and maintain your vehicle\\'s appearance, both inside and out. All of our ancillary products are transferrable to the new owner if you sell your vehicle; and, should you have a claim, there are no deductibles. Regardless of which CNA National product you select, our claims process is fast and easy.\\n\\nTire & Wheel Coverage\\n\\nWe have coverages that will either repair or replace tires or wheels damaged by a road hazard, such as a pothole, nail, or any object not normally found in the roadway. There is also optional coverage for wheels that sustain significant cosmetic damage, such as a scrape or dent. This valuable protection is not just for maintaining your vehicle’s appearance and safety, it also includes reimbursement for towing, flat-tire change assistance, and alternate transportation.\\n\\nPaintless Dent Repair (PDR)\\n\\nDents and dings can certainly ruin the appearance of any vehicle. CNA National offers coverages to get your vehicle looking good again! The PDR process uses specialized hand tools to return painted, dented sheet metal back to its original form. This process does not harm the vehicle’s original factory finish and no repainting is required.\\n\\nVehicle Protection Policy\\n\\nInterior and Exterior Protection\\n\\nIt’s happened to all of us...we parked under a tree with sap, or we spilled a beverage in our vehicle! We offer protection products for both the exterior and interior of your vehicle to keep it looking new. Treated exterior surfaces will be resistant to damage from environmental contaminants, including tree sap, insects, and hard-water spots. Our interior protection guards fabrics against stains from food, drinks, pets, gum, makeup, crayons, lotions, etc., and protects leather and vinyl from fading, discoloring, and cracking.\\n\\nRust Inhibitor and Undercoating Protection\\n\\nWhen this protection product is applied to your vehicle’s sheet-metal surfaces and underbody, it acts as a barrier to prevent rust damage and cracking, chipping, and peeling of metal surfaces.\\n\\nTheft Deterrent\\n\\nImagine looking for your vehicle in a crowded parking lot and realizing it’s gone! While we can’t guarantee that your vehicle will never be stolen, we can decrease the chances with our theft deterrent program. A traceable, unique identifier is applied to your vehicle to make it less attractive to thieves.\\n\\nWindshield Protection\\n\\nA damaged windshield can certainly affect the safe operation of your vehicle. Even if the damage doesn’t impede your ability to see the road, the windshield crack or chip can get worse over time and increase the cost of repair or replacement. Our windshield repair or replacement products are designed to reduce your out-of-pocket expense and get you back on the road quickly.\\n\\nNot available in all states; see the specific contract for coverage details, restrictions, and exclusions.', metadata={'source': 'versa.md'})]"

But what if your loan or lease balance is higher than the market value of your vehicle?\\n\\nAnswer: You would be responsible for paying off the difference, including your deductible. This can be expensive.\\n\\nThe reason for the potential difference is that normally the loan/lease balance decreases at a predictable amount as monthly payments are made. However, the market value of your vehicle is influenced by several variable factors (e.g. supply, demand, mileage). This means that market value often may be lower than your outstanding balance - particularly early in your contract when you have the most to lose.\\n\\nTHE CHOICE IS YOURS...\\n\\nGAP is an optional form of protection available only at the time you sign your Retail Finance or Lease Contract with the dealership. If you would like to know more about GAP, ask to see the GAP addendum.\\n\\nGuaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) can help waive the difference from the current market value of your vehicle.\\n\\nImportant Note: Based on your insurance company paying NADA Retail Value for the vehicle at the time of loss. The amount waived will not include any amount financed in excess of 120% of the MSRP for new vehicles or 120% of the NADA average retail value for used vehicles on the date of contract.\\n\\nDisclaimer: Besides the limitations listed on the back panel, terms and conditions may vary by state.\\n\\nAdditional Information: The percentage may vary.

Alternatively, you can call your own provider and we will reimburse you up to certain dollar limits.\\n\\nRental Car Reimbursement\\n\\nWe will pay for a rental vehicle when a covered breakdown occurs.\\n\\nTravel and Lodging Reimbursement\\n\\nWe will reimburse your meals and lodging up to a certain amount if you are stranded more than 100 miles from home due to a covered breakdown.\\n\\nWhat Does a Vehicle Service Contract Offer That a Factory Warranty Doesn’t?\\n\\nIn the event of a mechanical breakdown, a Vehicle Service Contract (VSC) can help reduce costs to repair or replace components not covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. The program also provides additional benefits such as towing, rental car, limp-along assistance, and emergency roadside assistance for covered breakdowns. The coverage continues until the expiration date of the contract or when the expiration odometer mileage is reached, whichever occurs first.\\n\\nCan a Vehicle Service Contract Save Me Money?\\n\\nYes. The new and advanced technology in today’s vehicles, combined with inflation, supply chain issues, and uncertainty about the future, have all increased the complexity of basic repairs. As a result, repair and labor costs are likely to continue increasing. The cost of just one significant repair could exceed the cost of purchasing a contract today.\\n\\nCan the Purchase Price Be Included in My Monthly Vehicle Payment?\\n\\nYes, the cost of coverage can be added to your monthly payment, but it can only be done when you purchase your vehicle. If you are financing your vehicle, ask your dealer how you can add the cost of this coverage to your finance contract.\\n\\nWhat Should I Do If My Vehicle Breaks Down?\\n\\n...\\n\\nEV Service Contract Policy Brochure\\n\\nEV Service Contract Policy Brochure\\n\\nWhere Can I Take My Vehicle for Repairs if I\\'m Far from Home?\\n\\nIf you\\'re unable to return to the dealership, your vehicle service contract will be accepted at thousands of licensed repair facilities throughout the U.S. and Canada. If you have a breakdown far from home, your towing benefit can help get you to a nearby repair facility.\\n\\nEV Service Contract\\n\\nWe assembled a team of experts who conducted detailed research across the industry and analyzed internal claims data to develop a service contract focused exclusively on battery-powered electric vehicles.\\n\\nElectric vehicles are distinctly different from gas-powered and hybrid vehicles. However, most other EV service contracts offer coverage for parts that are not even in the vehicle!\\n\\nExperienced\\n\\nWe\\'ve been covering electric vehicles with our Z2 service contract for more than five years. Based on the claims data we collected from those contracts combined with exhaustive research and intensive study of these automobiles, we\\'ve become the industry expert and built a service contract with the premier coverage that is synonymous with CNA National.\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nWe didn\\'t take the easy way by wedging a battery paragraph into our standard service contract. We built a one-of-a-kind service contract with four levels of coverage—from stated component to exclusionary with battery—designed to be attractive to consumers while also helping protect dealers\\' losses and reinsurance positions.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nWe took the initiative and time to learn about these unique vehicles to ensure we could not only offer a top-tier product, but also be able to effectively train and educate all of our clients on the marketing, sale, and administration of our EV service contract.

This product provides a service contract option unlike any other in the marketplace and will offer consumers peace of mind with their electric vehicle purchase.\\n\\nWhat is different about this new product?\\n\\nWe developed our electric vehicle service contract exclusively for battery-powered electric vehicles and created tiers of coverage specific to components found in these vehicles. We assembled a team of experts to conduct detailed research across the industry and analyzed internal claims data to better understand EV component failures, manufacturing procedures, and consumer concerns. Our expertise was then used to develop a service contract with protection specific to battery electric vehicles and their components.\\n\\nIs a new dealer agreement or sign-up needed?\\n\\nNo, a new dealer agreement or sign-up is not needed for this electric vehicle service contract.\\n\\nEV Service Contract Policy Brochure\\n\\nEV Service Contract Policy Brochure\\n\\nCoverage for Propulsion Battery\\n\\nThe Elite Protect with Battery tier offers the highest level of protection. The electric vehicle\\'s propulsion battery will be repaired or replaced when it retains less than the original equipment manufacturer\\'s capacity allowance.\\n\\nReinsurance Options\\n\\nThe EV service contract is eligible for all reinsurance options. Dealers signed up for Z2 reinsurance will automatically be signed up for reinsurance with the EV service contract.\\n\\nTermProtect Service Contract\\n\\nDrive with confidence on the road ahead.

The program also provides additional benefits such as towing, rental car, limp-along assistance, and emergency roadside assistance for covered breakdowns.

With the increasing complexity of vehicle repairs due to advanced technology, inflation, supply chain issues, and uncertainty about the future, repair and labor costs are likely to continue rising. The cost of a significant repair could exceed the price of purchasing a contract today.\\n\\nGuaranteed Asset Protection (GAP)\\n\\nWhen your vehicle is declared a total loss after an accident or theft, the actual cash value determined by your auto insurance company may be significantly less than the outstanding balance on your loan. Our GAP waiver programs can help cover the difference between the actual cash value of your vehicle and what you still owe.\\n\\nGAP Waiver Policy Brochure\\n\\nWhat is a GAP Waiver?\\n\\nA GAP waiver is designed to reduce or eliminate amounts remaining on your loan after your vehicle is stolen or declared a total loss.\\n\\nHow Does it Work?\\n\\nWhen your vehicle is declared a total loss due to theft or an accident, your primary automobile insurance will typically pay the actual cash value of the vehicle at the time of loss. This amount may be less than the outstanding balance on your loan, creating a \"gap.\" The GAP waiver helps by waiving some or all of what is owed, excluding certain items like past-due payments and late fees.\\n\\nCoverage Overview\\n\\nAvailable for new and used vehicles\\n\\nCan be financed on loans up to 84 months\\n\\nCan be financed on loans up to 150% of the MSRP (new vehicles) or NADA retail value (used vehicles)\\n\\nAvailable for vehicles with a retail sales value up to $100,000\\n\\nNote: Terms, conditions, limits of liability, exclusions, and state-specific provisions may vary. Please refer to the actual waiver for details.\\n\\nSubmitting a Claim\\n\\nIn order to submit a GAP waiver claim, your vehicle must first be declared a total loss by your insurance company. Contact your automobile insurance provider for more information.\\n\\nVisit the GAP Waiver Claim Documents page for a list of required documents to submit a claim.\\n\\nIllustrative Example for a $30,000 Loan\\n\\nIllustrative example content here...\\n\\nPolicy Brochure\\n\\nReduce or Eliminate Your Out-of-Pocket Expense with GAP\\n\\nYour out-of-pocket savings could be substantial:\\n\\nLoan balance: $30,000\\n\\nActual cash value of lost vehicle: -$22,000\\n\\nGap amount: $8,000\\n\\nPrimary insurance deductible: +$1,000\\n\\nTotal out-of-pocket expense: $9,000\\n\\nWith a GAP waiver, this amount can be reduced to as little as: $0\\n\\nFor illustrative purposes only. Your individual situation will vary depending on the details of your financing, vehicle specifics, and driving history. Some of your loan may remain even after the waiver is applied, due to missed payments, amounts previously due, late fees, and other adjustments, including any loan amount that exceeds 150% of the (“NADA”) Official Used Car Guide retail value of your vehicle.\\n\\nCertified Warranty\\n\\nCertified vehicles are increasingly important to today\\'s consumers. There is value in knowing a vehicle has been thoroughly inspected and vetted before resale, and CNA National works with select auto dealers to create dealer-certified warranty programs that offer a top level of coverage to help provide that reassurance.\\n\\nBenefits\\n\\nPurchasing a vehicle that comes with a limited warranty helps provide peace of mind against the unknowns that accompany buying a used car. CNA National works with select auto dealers to create certified warranty programs that can help eliminate some of these risks. Customers also have the opportunity to purchase a vehicle service contract that \"wraps\" around the coverage afforded in the limited warranty, adding additional years and often additional types of coverage that can help guard against unexpected repair costs.\\n\\nCoverage\\n\\nAsk your dealer what type and term of limited warranty they offer. And be sure to ask about CNA National service contracts to wrap the limited warranty!\\n\\nLimited Powertrain Warranties & Wraps\\n\\nCNA National Warranty and Service Contracts\\n\\nWarranty Options\\n\\nDealers can offer customers a choice of limited powertrain warranties at no additional cost, designed to cover repairs of powertrain components.\\n\\nYou can even add an optional \"wrap\" service contract to enhance the warranty with additional comprehensive coverage.\\n\\nLifetime Limited Warranty\\n\\nThe CNA National Lifetime Limited Powertrain Warranty and Lifetime Wrap program can provide consumers with mechanical breakdown coverage for as long as they own the vehicle.\\n\\nUnlimited Miles & Stated Time\\n\\nThe CNA National Unlimited Miles & Stated Time Powertrain Warranty and Wrap program can provide mechanical breakdown coverage for consumers who need higher mileage limits.\\n\\nUnlimited Time & Stated Miles\\n\\nThe CNA National Unlimited Time & Stated Miles Powertrain Warranty and Wrap program can provide consumers with mechanical breakdown coverage for the long term owner.\\n\\nAncillary Suite of Products\\n\\nWe can help keep your vehicle looking good, too! Our ancillary product mix is diverse and provides products to protect and maintain your vehicle\\'s appearance, both inside and out. All of our ancillary products are transferrable to the new owner if you sell your vehicle; and, should you have a claim, there are no deductibles. Regardless of which CNA National product you select, our claims process is fast and easy.\\n\\nTire & Wheel Coverage\\n\\nWe have coverages that will either repair or replace tires or wheels damaged by a road hazard, such as a pothole, nail, or any object not normally found in the roadway. There is also optional coverage for wheels that sustain significant cosmetic damage, such as a scrape or dent. This valuable protection is not just for maintaining your vehicle’s appearance and safety, it also includes reimbursement for towing, flat-tire change assistance, and alternate transportation.\\n\\nPaintless Dent Repair (PDR)\\n\\nDents and dings can certainly ruin the appearance of any vehicle. CNA National offers coverages to get your vehicle looking good again! The PDR process uses specialized hand tools to return painted, dented sheet metal back to its original form. This process does not harm the vehicle’s original factory finish and no repainting is required.\\n\\nVehicle Protection Policy\\n\\nInterior and Exterior Protection\\n\\nIt’s happened to all of us...we parked under a tree with sap, or we spilled a beverage in our vehicle! We offer protection products for both the exterior and interior of your vehicle to keep it looking new. Treated exterior surfaces will be resistant to damage from environmental contaminants, including tree sap, insects, and hard-water spots. Our interior protection guards fabrics against stains from food, drinks, pets, gum, makeup, crayons, lotions, etc., and protects leather and vinyl from fading, discoloring, and cracking.\\n\\nRust Inhibitor and Undercoating Protection\\n\\nWhen this protection product is applied to your vehicle’s sheet-metal surfaces and underbody, it acts as a barrier to prevent rust damage and cracking, chipping, and peeling of metal surfaces.\\n\\nTheft Deterrent\\n\\nImagine looking for your vehicle in a crowded parking lot and realizing it’s gone! While we can’t guarantee that your vehicle will never be stolen, we can decrease the chances with our theft deterrent program. A traceable, unique identifier is applied to your vehicle to make it less attractive to thieves.\\n\\nWindshield Protection\\n\\nA damaged windshield can certainly affect the safe operation of your vehicle. Even if the damage doesn’t impede your ability to see the road, the windshield crack or chip can get worse over time and increase the cost of repair or replacement. Our windshield repair or replacement products are designed to reduce your out-of-pocket expense and get you back on the road quickly.\\n\\nNot available in all states; see the specific contract for coverage details, restrictions, and exclusions.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\prabh\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\menuverse\\\\demo_rag1\\\\versa.md'})]"
