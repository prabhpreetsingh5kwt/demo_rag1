## WHEN THINKING ABOUT BUYING, CONSIDER THESE FACTS.

FACT #1 Your manufacturer’s warranty is very comprehensive. It covers virtually every part in your vehicle and can help prevent you from paying expensive repair bills. The problem is that when it does, you are exposed to the costs of unexpected and expensive auto repair bills.

FACT #2 As your vehicle gets older, the risk and cost of repairs may increase.

FACT #3 Each year, more and more sophisticated technology is built into vehicles to improve their safety, performance, comfort, and value. These same innovations increase the vehicle’s reliability. However, if something does go wrong, the necessary repairs are often complex and costly.

ARE YOU PREPARED TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE? Is the amount you receive from your insurance company enough to pay-off your loan or lease balance if your vehicle is declared a total loss? EXAMPLE Insurance Settlement (Market Value of Vehicle*) $13,000 Amount you owe on a loan or lease $18,500 Difference ($5,000) In this example, the answer is No! The difference illustrates what you would still owe your lender without GAP. The above is an example for illustrative purposes. Your situation will vary based on your specific loan/lease and insurance coverage. DEDUCTIBLE You may be responsible for the entire amount of your physical damage insurance deductible. See the GAP addendum for specific details. REFINANCE GAP coverage is terminated if the Retail Installment Sales Contract is refinanced. SETTLEMENT DEDUCTIONS GAP addendum amount does not include insurance settlement deductions for customer retained salvage, unrepaired physical damage, towing, rental or storage. NON-COVERED FINANCE ITEMS GAP addendum amount does not include late payments, deferred payments, late charges/ interest or interest after the date of loss. FIRST MILE GUARANTEED LOST EQUITY GAP does not refund advance payments or vehicle equity. UNCANCELLED ADD-ONS GAP addendum amount does not include the refundable portion of any finance additions such as credit insurance or service agreements. CUSTOMER SECURED FINANCING GAP does not apply to any loan obtained from any finance source other than the dealer. INSURANCE GAP does not provide any insurance coverage for you or the vehicle, such as collision, comprehensive, bodily injury, property damage or liability. GAP is not a replacement for primary auto insurance. In case of a breakdown, you must contact the selling dealer.

ANDROID IOS ASSET PROTECTION IN THE EVENT OF A TOTAL LOSS OF YOUR VEHICLE, YOU MAY OWE MORE THAN WHAT YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY WILL PAY Total Warranty Services TWS-GAP (08/21) - 92778 GAP WAIVES THE DIFFERENCE In the unfortunate event your vehicle is declared a total loss due to an unrecoverable theft or accidental damage, your auto insurance company will typically pay the current market value of your vehicle less your deductible. But what if your loan or lease balance is higher than the market value of your vehicle? Answer: You would be responsible for paying off the difference, including your deductible. This can be expensive. The reason for the potential difference is that normally the loan/lease balance decreases at a predictable amount as monthly payments are made. However, the market value of your vehicle is influenced by several variable factors (e.g. supply, demand, mileage). This means that market value often may be lower than your outstanding balance - particularly early in your contract when you have the most to lose. Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) can help waive the difference from the current market value of your vehicle.

Z2 Service Contract The advanced technology that is built into today’s vehicles has increased the complexity and expertise needed for even the simplest of repairs. As a result, repair costs and labor rates have risen and will likely continue to do so. The cost of even one future repair may easily exceed the cost of purchasing a service contract. While it's important to take care of your vehicle in accordance with the manufacturer guidelines, even with the best attention and care to your vehicle, mechanical breakdowns can occur unexpectedly and require costly repairs. The simple truth is that even the most reliable vehicles on the road are at risk for a breakdown, especially as your vehicle ages and accrues mileage. If you have a vehicle service contract, you can drive knowing that you have coverage that will be there even after your manufacturer’s basic warranty has expired, which is when you are likely to need it the most. We offer four levels of coverage ranging from basic powertrain to exclusionary, which is our top-of the-line contract that provides coverage for all the parts of your vehicle, unless they are specifically excluded in the contract.

BENEFITS Wide range of service contract options No exclusions for normal wear and tear Multiple deductible options to choose from Repair facilities throughout the U.S. and Canada Option to extend coverage before contract term expires No exclusions for covered pre-existing conditions COVERAGE With any of our service contracts, you have the confidence of knowing that your vehicle has coverage throughout the United States and Canada. You can even choose the length and type of coverage that best fits your driving habits and matches your specific needs. Hopefully you will never have a problem, but driving with a service contract will reassure you while on the road. In addition to paying for covered repairs, CNA National service contracts include these benefits: Towing and emergency roadside assistance Travel and lodging reimbursement Rental car reimbursement Vehicle service contract diagram Valuable features of your coverage Roadside assistance Simply call our toll-free number 24 hours a day, seven days a week for our sign-and-drive service or towing. Or, you can call your own provider and we will reimburse you up to a certain dollar limits. Rental car reimbursement We will pay for

Whatdoesa vehicle service contract offer that a factory warranty doesn’t? In the event of a mechanical breakdown, a vehicle service contract (VSC) can help reduce costs to repair or replace components that are not covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. The program also provides additional benefits such as towing, rental car, limp-along assistance, and emergency roadside assistance for covered breakdowns. The coverage continues until the expiration date of the contract or when the expiration odometer mileage is reached, whichever occurs first. Can avehicle service contract save me money? Yes. The new and advanced technology in today’s vehicles combined with inflation, supply chain issues and uncertainty about the future have all increased the complexity of basic repairs. As a result, repair and labor costs are likely to continue increasing. The cost of just one significant repair could exceed the cost of purchasing a contract today. Can the purchase price be included in my monthly vehicle payment? Yes, the cost of coverage can be added to your monthly payment, but it can only be done when you purchase your vehicle. If you are financing your vehicle, ask your dealer how you can add the cost of this coverage to your finance contract. Whatshould I do if myvehicle breaks down? If possible, return to the dealership and, if needed, make sure to take advantage of your plan’s towing benefit to prevent further damage. Have the repair facility call before beginning any repairs or parts are replaced. Wherecan I takemyvehicle for repairs if I’m far from home? If you’re unable to return to the dealership, your vehicle service contract will be accepted at thousands of licensed repair facilities throughout the U.S. and Canada. If you have a breakdown far from home, your towing benefit can help get you to a nearby repair facility.

(GAP) When your vehicle is declared a total loss after an accident or theft, the actual cash value as determined by your auto insurance company may be significantly less than the outstanding balance on your loan. We administer multiple GAP waiver programs that can help cover the difference between the actual cash value of your vehicle and what you still owe. What is a GAP waiver? A GAP waiver is designed to reduce or even eliminate amounts remaining on your loan after your vehicle is stolen or is declared a total loss. When a vehicle is declared a total loss, due to theft or accident, the primary automobile insurance will typically pay the actual cash value of the vehicle at the time of loss. This amount can be less than the outstanding balance on the loan. The difference between the amount paid by the insurer and the remaining balance on the loan is often referred to as the "gap." The owner of the vehicle remains responsible for paying these amounts to the lender. GAP waivers can help limit this financial obligation by waiving some or all of what is owed, excluding certain items such as past-due payment amounts and late fees. GAP waivers even include coverage for some insurance deductibles up to $1,000. GAP waivers are offered as an addendum to your auto loan so must be purchased during the financing transaction.

Coverage Overview

|Available for|new and used vehicles|
|---|---|
|Can be financed on loans up to|84 months|
|Can be financed on loans up to|150 percent of the MSRP (new vehicles) or NADA retail value (used vehicles)*|
|Available for vehicles with a retail sales value up to|$100,000*|

*Does not apply to all GAP products. Please see the actual waiver for terms, conditions, limits of liability, exclusions and state-specific provisions that may change your coverage and/or benefits.

Submit a GAP waiver claim

In order to submit a GAP waiver claim, your vehicle must first be declared a total loss by your insurance company. If you have not done so already, please contact your automobile insurance provider. Visit GAP Waiver Claim Documents to get a list of documents required to submit a claim.

Illustrative example for a $30,000 loan

REDUCE OR ELIMINATE YOUR OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSE WITH GAP

Your out-of-pocket savings could be substantial: Let's say your loan balance is: $30,000 Your insurance company says the actual cash value of your lost vehicle is: Leaving you with a "gap" of: $8,000 Primary insurance deductible is: + $1,000 Total out-of-pocket expense: $9,000 A GAP waiver can reduce this amount to as little as: -$22,000 $0 For illustrative purposes only. Your individual situation will vary depending on the details of your financing, vehicle specifics and driving history. Some of your loan may remain even after the waiver is applied, due to missed payments, amounts previously due, late fees and other adjustments, including any loan amount that exceeds 150% of the (“NADA”) Official Used Car Guide retail value of your vehicle.

Certified Warranty

Certified vehicles are increasingly important to today's consumers. There is value in knowing a vehicle has been thoroughly inspected and vetted before resale, and CNA National works with select auto dealers to create dealer-certified warranty programs that offer a top level of coverage to help provide that reassurance.

BENEFITS

Purchasing a vehicle that comes with a limited warranty helps provide peace of mind against the unknowns that accompany buying a used car. CNA National works with select auto dealers to create certified warranty programs that can help eliminate some of these risks. Customers also have the opportunity to purchase a vehicle service contract that "wraps" around the coverage afforded in the limited warranty, adding additional years and often additional types of coverage that can help guard against unexpected repair costs.

COVERAGE

Ask your dealer what type and term of limited warranty they offer. And be sure to ask about CNA National service contracts to wrap the limited warranty! Limited Powertrain Warranties & Wraps Dealers can offer customers a choice
